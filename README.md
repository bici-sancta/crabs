evaluation of claw force in relation to height


1. As part of a study of the effects of predatory intertidal crab species on snail populations, researchers measured the mean closing forces and the propodus heights of the claws on several crabs of three species. The data is in the file crab.csv.  
a. Step 1: Use the code from Dr. McGee’s lecture to plot a scatter plot of claw closing force versus propodus height, with different plotting symbols (or colors) to distinguish the three different crab species.  Judging from an initial visual assessment of the scatterplots, you may apply a transformation and replot in this step.  If a transformation is necessary, you only need to provide the scatterplot for the most visually satisfying transformation for now.  You will formally assess the fit of the model in Step 4.  Please provide these plots in both R and SAS and provide the code for each.  
b. Step 2:  Build a model (simply write it out like we did on the board or like it is done on “Second Step” in the Power Point slide for the life span versus metabolism example.)  This model should allow for separate fits (separate lines) for each crab and should also allow for each line to have its own slope.  
c. Step 3: Fit the model.  Please do this in both SAS and R.  Provide the proc glm or proc reg statement in SAS as well as the code used in R.  In addition provide a screen shot of the parameter estimate tables output in both SAS and R.  
d. Step 4: Provide a residual plot, studentized residual plot, histogram of residuals and qq plot of residuals to provide evidence of the appropriateness of the model (Please provide the plots in both SAS and R.)  Provide each plot and short 1 or two sentence description of each plot.  
e. Step 5: if the fit assessed in Step 4 is sufficient, interpret each coefficient in the model.
